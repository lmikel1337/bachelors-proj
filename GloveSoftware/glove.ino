/*
Software solution which reads Accelerometer,
Gyroscope and Magnetometer values
From the MPU-9250 motion sensor.
The raw data is then interpreted and flushed
In the serial port.
Software was built to be ran on the ESP32 architecture
And as a result, itâ€™s compatibility has only been checked on
The ESP-32 based microcontrollers.
This code was uploaded to a ESP-32-WROOM microcontroller.
